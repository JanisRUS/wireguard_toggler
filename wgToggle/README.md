# How to install?

Run install.sh under root
Ah, don't forget to install wg-quick, ofc)

# How to use?

Run wgToggle.desktop

# How to uninstall

Run ~/.wgToggle/uninstall.sh

# Why do i need this?

If you don't want to write "wg-quick up/down myvpn.conf".
I didn't want to, so I made this script

# How to change interface name?

Rewrite ~/.wgToggle/interface file. Example: "myvpn"

# It doesn't work

I did it in a hurry, so I tested it only on basic Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with GNOME, so if your OS is different, then the script may not work

# The icon is not always updated. What to do?

Idk, I still haven't figured out how to get gnome to update the icon immediately
